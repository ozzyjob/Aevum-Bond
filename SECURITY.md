# üîê Security Policy - Aevum & Bond

## üéØ Security Overview

Aevum & Bond takes security seriously as a post-quantum dual-ledger blockchain ecosystem. This document outlines our security policies, procedures, and guidelines for maintaining the highest security standards.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Principles

### Core Security Tenets
1. **Post-Quantum Readiness**: All cryptographic implementations must be quantum-resistant
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for all components
4. **Security by Design**: Security considerations in every architectural decision
5. **Transparent Security**: Open security processes and vulnerability disclosure

## üîí Cryptographic Security

### Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards

**Digital Signatures:**
- **Primary**: ML-DSA (FIPS 204)
- **Key Sizes**: 2048-bit minimum
- **Implementation**: Constant-time algorithms
- **Side-Channel Protection**: Required for all implementations

```rust
// Example secure signature implementation
pub struct MLDSASecure {
    private_key: SecureBox<MLDSAPrivateKey>,
}

impl MLDSASecure {
    pub fn sign(&self, message: &[u8]) -> Result<Signature, CryptoError> {
        // Constant-time signing implementation
        // Side-channel attack mitigation
        // Memory clearing after use
    }
}
```

**Hash Functions:**
- **Primary**: SHA-3 (Keccak)
- **Applications**: Block hashing, Merkle trees, address generation
- **Output Size**: 256-bit minimum

**Key Management:**
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) support
- Secure key generation with entropy validation
- Key rotation procedures
- Secure key storage with encryption at rest

### Cryptographic Review Process

**Pre-Implementation:**
1. Cryptographic design review
2. Algorithm selection justification
3. Security parameter validation
4. Side-channel analysis plan

**Implementation Review:**
1. Code review by cryptography experts
2. Constant-time implementation verification
3. Side-channel testing
4. Formal verification (when applicable)

**Post-Implementation:**
1. Third-party security audit
2. Penetration testing
3. Continuous monitoring
4. Regular security updates

## üåê Network Security

### P2P Network Security

**Connection Security:**
- **Encryption**: Noise Protocol Framework
- **Authentication**: Node identity verification
- **Transport**: TCP with TLS 1.3
- **DDoS Protection**: Rate limiting and connection throttling

**Peer Management:**
- Peer reputation system
- Blacklisting of malicious nodes
- Peer diversity requirements
- Eclipse attack prevention

```rust
// Secure peer connection example
pub struct SecurePeerConnection {
    noise_session: NoiseSession,
    reputation: PeerReputation,
    rate_limiter: TokenBucket,
}

impl SecurePeerConnection {
    pub async fn establish_connection(&mut self, peer: PeerId) -> Result<(), NetworkError> {
        // 1. Verify peer identity
        // 2. Establish encrypted channel
        // 3. Initialize rate limiting
        // 4. Update peer reputation
    }
}
```

### Network Monitoring

**Threat Detection:**
- Anomaly detection for unusual traffic patterns
- Malicious peer identification
- Attack pattern recognition
- Real-time alerting system

**Monitoring Metrics:**
- Connection success/failure rates
- Message propagation times
- Peer churn rates
- Bandwidth utilization

## üîê Consensus Security

### Bond Chain (PoW) Security

**Mining Security:**
- Double-spending prevention
- 51% attack resistance
- Selfish mining mitigation
- Mining pool decentralization

**Block Validation:**
- Proof-of-Work verification
- Transaction validation
- UTXO consistency checks
- Timestamp validation

```rust
// Secure block validation
pub fn validate_block_secure(block: &Block, chain_state: &ChainState) -> Result<(), ValidationError> {
    // 1. Verify proof-of-work meets difficulty target
    verify_proof_of_work(&block.header)?;
    
    // 2. Validate all transactions
    for tx in &block.transactions {
        validate_transaction_secure(tx, chain_state)?;
    }
    
    // 3. Check block structure and constraints
    validate_block_structure(block)?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```
